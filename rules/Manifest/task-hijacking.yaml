      This Android mobile application seems to be vulnerable to task hijacking.
      The StrandHogg attack / Task Affinity vulnerability was enabled / caused by a design bug in the way Android handled multiple tasks, specifically the feature called task reparenting. 
      Application task reparenting is a feature that allows an application to move an activity from one task to another.
